# HA AI Companion

An AI-powered Home Assistant companion that helps you manage configuration, automate your home, and remember your setup — all through natural language.

---

## What it does

- **Review, edit and create dashboards** — ask the AI to build or modify Lovelace dashboards
- **Manage configuration files** — automations, scripts, YAML configs, devices, entities, areas
- **Suggest automations** — based on your actual live entity states
- **Persistent memory** — remembers your preferences and setup across sessions
- **Node-RED integration** — reads your existing flows to avoid duplicate automations
- **Conversation history** — sessions saved and accessible across page reloads

All changes go through a safe approval workflow: the AI proposes, you see a visual diff, then approve or reject.

## Features in detail

### Safe change workflow
1. You ask for a change in plain English
2. The AI reads the current configuration
3. Proposes changes — shown as a visual diff
4. You approve or reject (no change is applied without your confirmation)
5. On approval: backup created → change written → HA validates → rollback if validation fails

### Dashboard management
- List all Lovelace dashboards
- Read and edit existing dashboards (default and custom)
- Create new dashboards with a title and icon
- Delete dashboards

### Memory system
The AI remembers facts across sessions using categorised memory files:
- `preference_` — your stated preferences
- `device_` — device names, locations
- `identity_` — home structure, room layout
- `baseline_` — normal sensor ranges
- `pattern_` — recurring routines
- `correction_` — corrections to previous facts

### Automation suggestions
Ask "suggest automations for my home" — the AI fetches live entity states and existing automations/Node-RED flows before suggesting, so it never duplicates what you already have.

### Conversation sessions
All conversations are saved automatically. Use the sidebar to switch between past sessions or start a new one.
